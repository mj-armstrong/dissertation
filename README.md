Machine Learning Tool

This is a tool to run some basic cleaning operations, build a classifier and make predicitons.

To run it needs 
streamlit
scikit learn v0.23 (v0.24 causes issues with yellowbrick)
yellowbrick
seaborn
pandas
numpy
matlab

Most of these can be installed with an install of Anaconda.
Could be altered to remove need for yellowbrick (removing need to rollback scikit learn).
